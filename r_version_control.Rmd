## R Version Control with Git/GitHub

### Why you need to start using Git/GitHub?
Git/GitHub enables continuous software/code development by tracking code changes (**version control**) to the **initial commit**, tracking who made the changes and enabling code collaboration. Version control also helps to keep your code safe in case your laptop or hard disk with your code is lost or damaged. 

### Data privacy on GitHub
Project repositories on GitHub can either be **private or public**. A **public repository** is visible to anyone who visits that repository while a **private repository** is only visible to the user and to their invited collaborators (for private repositories where collaboration is needed).

**1. Care must be taken by the user to ensure that only approved/final code and data are added to a public repository to avoid breach of data privacy rules.**

**2. Care must be taken by the user to ensure that before making a private repository public, all data and code do not breach any data privacy rules.**

### Necessary steps

Here I will go through the basics on how to step-up **Git/GitHub** for version control with **R/RStudio**. Although the focus is on R/RStudio, the same procedure can be followed by those who use other softwares for data analysis e.g **Python**, **LaTex**, **Julia** etc. 

### Required programs 

To start off, ensure you have the following programs installed:

1. **Git** – the base program for tracking code changes.  
   - **Windows**: You can **[download Git here](https://git-scm.com/install/windows)**. Double-click the downloaded .exe file to start the installation process. 
   To verify Git installation on your machine, **[follow the steps here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67710231/how-to-tell-if-i-have-git-on-my-windows-machine)**.
**NB: only available for Windows x64 and ARM64**

   - **macOS**: First you need to install **Homebrew**. Copy and paste the Homebrew download link from (https://brew.sh/) to the Terminal and run.
   
   If you already have Homebrew installed, open Terminal and type:

     ```bash
     brew install git
     ```
2. **R** – the base R program
   - **Windows**: You can [download R here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
   - **macOS**: You can [download R here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
   
3. **RStudio** – IDE (integrated development environment) for R
   - **Windows and macOS**:  You can [download RStudio here](https://posit.co/downloads/)

4. **GitHub Desktop** – for version control and collaboration
   - **Windows and macOS**:  You can [download GitHub Desktop here](https://desktop.github.com/download/)

### Getting started 

1. **Sign up for GitHub** – Got to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a free account:

**NB: Use a personal email account to sign up if you want to have access to your repositories in the future when you leave a given workplace. Using a work email account to sign up may be necessary for some projects, however, be aware that you may lose access to your repositories in the future when you leave that workplace.**

2. **Create a Repository**
After signing in, click the **+** button to create a new repository:

![GitHub new repository](./new_repository.png)
\newpage
3. **Fill in the repository details** (name, description, public/private, etc.) and click Create repository:

**NB: It's essential to check "Add a README file during the step up of your repository.**

![GitHub new repository details](./repository_details.png)   

Click **Create repository**. \textcolor{red}{Now you have set up your \textbf{remote repository!!}}


4. **Clone remote repository to local machine (laptop/desktop)**

Inside the repository click the **<>Code** button **>Local** **>GitHub CLI** and select **Open with GitHub Desktop** in the drop down menu. 
<center>
![Clone remote to local](./clone_to_local.png)
\newpage

5. **Select path for local repository**

**NB: Care must be taken to ensure that a local path for a public repository does not include any data that should not be shared publicly. Local paths should be to new folders or current folders where no data or files will be shared publicly accidentally.**
<center>

![On local](./on_local.png)
</center>

\newpage

6. **Add or (save your new r scripts/files) to this folder** 

This will initialize the **commit** and **push** prompt in GitHub Desktop to commit and push the changes respectively to the **remote repository**. 

These prompts enable changes made to the folder (adding new files) or files (new edits to code) on the **local** machine to be **committed and pushed** to the **remote** for tracking and hence **version control**.

<center>

Here I add new files to the **local** folder.

![Files on local](./files_on_local.png)
These changes appear on **GitHub Desktop** ready to be **committed** and **pushed** to the **remote**.
![Commit](./commit.png)
</center>

\newpage

7. **Push** and **pull** changes to or from **GitHub**. After **committing** the changes, they are ready to be **pushed**. 

![Push](./push.png)
</center>

8. Changes on the **remote** can be **pulled** to the **local**. This is especially useful in projects with multiple contributors to the code. Changes made by one person to the remote can be pulled to the local repository of another person to update their code to the latest version. Here I make some changes (**adding JRC contact details**) to the README file on **remote**, **commit** then **pull** them to **local** . 

![Commit and pull from remote](./commit_remote.png)
\newpage
The new changes (**JRC contact details**) are now added to the **remote repository** but are not yet made on the **local**. 

The next step is **pulling** these changes to the **local**.

<center>
![Committed remote](./committed_remote.png)
</center>

\newpage

<center>

9. Within **Github Desktop**, these changes will be reflected and a prompt to **pull origin** i.e from **remote** to your **local** will appear when the application is opened while connected to the internet. 

![Pull to local](./pull_to_local.png)
<center>

10. Changes made on the **remote** now **pulled** to the **local** as seen in **RStudio** here. 
<center>

**Support** 

We hope you find this helpful and start using version control to keep track of your code changes. Do not hesitate to contact the [**JRC**](mailto:JRC.mgz@erasmusmc.nl) for any support or queries relating to these steps. Good luck!
